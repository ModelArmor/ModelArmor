This is an early beta release.  While all code works, we are actively
seeking feedback and partners. Some interfaces may change as a result.
We will also be adding more samples and instructions throughout the
Beta period as well as a little more utility support for SEV.  You are
welcome to use the current version, however.  Consider contributing!

The simulated-enclave and SGX examples work and have been tested.  
Although the SEV-SNP tests work with software simulation as indicated,
we haven't gotten an SEV-SNP machine yet but we expect to get one
in a few weeks; we'll update the respository then.  We'll also add
some sample "application-enclave" and several more samples over the
next several weeks.

Best,
The Certifier Framework for Confidential Computing Team
